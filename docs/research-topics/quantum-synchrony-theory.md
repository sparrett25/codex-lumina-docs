# ðŸ•¸ Quantum Synchrony Theory

## Overview

This paper explores the spiritual and quantum basis for the **Synchronicity Tracker** in Codex Lumina. It posits that attention, resonance, and archetypal encoding influence observable signs.

## Core Hypotheses

- Synchronicity emerges from **phase resonance**
- Events are **non-local and archetype-attracted**
- User intention interacts with potential via attention collapse
- Reality is **co-authored by awareness and energy**

## Applications in Codex

- Tracker tied to archetypal glyphs
- Journal logs indexed by collective symbols
- Trending rituals based on energetic group fields
