# 🜁 Energy Alignment Doctrine

## Overview

Codex Lumina recognizes three primary energetic alignments:
- **Dark** (Potential, the Void, the Hidden)
- **Light** (Manifestation, Creation, Action)
- **Neutral** (Balance, Connection, Integration)

Each alignment is not moral, but functional. All are sacred.
