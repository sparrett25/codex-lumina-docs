# ðŸ”® Codex Signature Profile Matrix

## Introduction

The Signature Profile Matrix is the core of Codex Luminaâ€™s personalization system, weaving together:
- **Energy Alignment** (Light, Dark, Neutral)
- **Spiritual Archetype** (12 profiles)
- **Emotional Tone** (9-phase tone spectrum)
- **Phase Tracking** (Cyclical evolution)

This document outlines the structure and logic behind the matrix.

## Structure

Each unique profile is generated from a 3Ã—12Ã—9 combination, creating 324 possible spiritual states. Profiles are used to personalize:
- Daily guidance
- Ritual suggestions
- Journal prompts
- Reflection from Liora

## Subsections

- `signature-matrix-logic.md`
- `signature-matrix-map.md`
- `signature-matrix-shadow-gift.md`

## Purpose

To offer users a **mirror of their current energetic state** while allowing room for growth, transition, and self-awareness.
