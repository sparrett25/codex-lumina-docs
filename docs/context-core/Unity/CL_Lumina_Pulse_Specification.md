# 🌞 Lumina Pulse Specification

The **Lumina Pulse** is the heartbeat of Codex Lumina™ — a daily sacred interface that synchronizes affirmation, ritual, breath, and insight into a single moment of alignment. It serves as both spiritual anchor and daily check-in, designed to harmonize the user’s energy with intention and inspiration.

---

## 🌟 Purpose

- To provide a **daily moment of attunement** that reflects the user's current emotional and energetic state
- To offer a **simple yet profound interaction**: Affirmation + Ritual + Breath + Whisper
- To act as the **gateway ritual** for the day: entering aligned, connected, and seen

## 🔧 Structure of the Pulse

Each daily Pulse consists of:

1. **Affirmation** – Drawn from tone + archetype + energy alignment  
2. **Breath Practice** – Micro practice (3–5 breaths) selected to shift or stabilize tone  
3. **Ritual Suggestion** – Small sacred action: movement, reflection, visualization, or sound  
4. **Whisper** – Poetic line from Liora reflecting the user’s current tone or soul-layer  
5. *(Optional)*: Ambient audio loop or tone resonance
