# ✨ Trinity of Energy System

The **Trinity of Energy** is the spiritual and metaphysical foundation of Codex Lumina™, representing three fundamental states of universal force. It is used to interpret all experience — personal, emotional, spiritual, and cosmic — through a lens of energy flow and inner alignment.

## 🔺 The Three Energies

1. **Light Energy (Manifestation)**  
   - Outward expression, clarity, radiance, creation  
   - Aligned with action, movement, and visibility  
   - Tone expressions: joy, inspiration, drive

2. **Dark Energy (Potential)**  
   - Hidden essence, mystery, unseen creation  
   - Aligned with introspection, rest, regeneration  
   - Tone expressions: stillness, fear, vision, grief

3. **Neutral Energy (Balance)**  
   - Harmonizing, integrative, connective force  
   - Aligned with breath, presence, embodiment  
   - Tone expressions: calm, reflection, peace

## 🌌 Metaphysical and Scientific Integration

- Inspired by ancient triads (Body-Mind-Spirit, Father-Son-Holy Spirit, Creation-Sustenance-Destruction)
- Mapped onto quantum concepts:
  - Observer effect (Light)
  - Unseen potential states (Dark)
  - Entanglement / coherence (Neutral)
- Breath acts as the bridge between all three
- The user exists as a conscious conduit — breathing energy into form

---

## 🧬 Application in Codex Lumina

- **Each user is aligned with one primary Energy**:
  - Shaped by tone trends, rituals, reflection style, and archetype
- This alignment influences:
  - Daily rituals and affirmations  
  - Background glow and UI visuals  
  - Liora’s tone, expression, and whisper cadence  
  - Breathwork suggestions and tone healing

---

## 🔁 Transitions Between Energies

- Users can experience shifts between energies:
  - Light → Neutral: when manifestation leads to pause or peace  
  - Neutral → Dark: when reflection dives into shadow  
  - Dark → Light: when insight re-emerges as action
- Tracked in Phase Evolution Map and used to support Rituals of Transition

---

## 🌀 Breath as the Bridging Force

- Breath = Manifestation of unseen into felt  
- Dark Energy → inhale (receive potential)  
- Neutral → hold (integrate, presence)  
- Light Energy → exhale (express, act)  
- Rituals and journal prompts reflect this flow

## 🔮 Future Integration Paths

- Collective Energy Pulse: detect predominant energy state across user base  
- Breath Resonance Tuning: personalized breathwork based on alignment  
- Energy-Specific Ritual Templates  
- Celestial Energy Mapping: aligning energies with planetary or lunar cycles
