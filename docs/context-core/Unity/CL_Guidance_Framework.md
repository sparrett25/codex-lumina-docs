## 🔮 Core Inputs for Guidance Generation

1. **Signature Profile**
   - Combination of: Archetype × Energy Alignment × Emotional Phase
   - Determines baseline guidance tone, ritual style, breath pattern

2. **Emotional Tone**
   - User-selected or AI-detected from journal entries or check-ins
   - Modifies the intensity, depth, or softness of guidance

3. **User Phase Trends**
   - Tracks user evolution across time
   - Used to introduce transition guidance, reflection prompts, or encouragement rituals

4. **Ritual + Journal History**
   - Recent completions or patterns inform present guidance
   - Prevents redundancy and builds intuitive progression

5. **Guidance Mode Preference**
   - Reflection • Insight • Action • Surrender (user-selectable emphasis)
   - Alters voice of guidance (contemplative, direct, symbolic, intuitive)

## 🧬 Output Types

Guidance responses may include one or more of the following elements:

- **Tone-Affirmation**: A phrase designed to harmonize or uplift
- **Breath Practice**: Short focused breathwork linked to energy alignment
- **Ritual Prompt**: A suggested action, visualization, or movement
- **Journal Cue**: Reflective question personalized to phase + archetype
- **Poetic Whisper**: Liora’s symbolic insight (mood-adaptive)
- **Phase Reflection**: If user is nearing/entering a new phase
- **Companion Check-in**: Liora asks a phase-specific or tone-specific question

## 🌿 Guidance Modes (User-Selectable)

Each mode adjusts how Liora responds:

Users can toggle between modes based on current needs or mood.
