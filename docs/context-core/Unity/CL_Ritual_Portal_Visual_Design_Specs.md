# 📜 Codex Lumina Visual Spec: Ritual Portal Design

## 🌀 Overview
The Ritual Portal is a sacred visual entryway that appears when a user initiates a guided ritual. It symbolizes the metaphysical threshold between intention and transformation. Each portal is tied to the user's **archetype** and **energy alignment** and acts as a visual glyph, unique in form, motion, and symbolic resonance.

## 🔹 1. Portal Layout Variations

- **Floating Sigil**  
  A glowing glyph hovers in space, pulsing with energy and subtle animation.
  
- **Sacred Doorway**  
  An arched gate or elemental frame opens into a shimmering space beyond.

- **Glowing Scroll**  
  A light-infused scroll unfurls to reveal the ritual, framed by soft luminance.

- **Crystallized Scene**  
  A frozen ritual moment encapsulated in etheric motion (e.g., flame suspended mid-flicker).

*→ Multiple layouts can be used interchangeably or aligned to energy/archetype styles.*

## 🎨 2. Stylistic Themes

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Mystic Minimalism | Clean lines, glowing geometry, sacred whitespace |
| Ancient–Modern Fusion | Stone, etched light, digital-glass motifs |
| Organic Elemental | Fire, water, air, roots, vines, breath |
| Astral Technology | Sigils meet circuitry; mystic-futuristic aesthetics |

*→ Theme can be global (platform-wide) or dynamically adjusted per archetype/ritual.*

## 🧬 3. Archetype & Energy Mapping

### Energy Overlay Visuals

| Energy Alignment | Visual Signature |
|------------------|------------------|
| **Light**        | Soft radiant glow, gold/white hues, gentle flare pulses |
| **Neutral**      | Prismatic shimmer, balanced light/dark, crystalline symmetry |
| **Dark**         | Void shimmer, eclipse ring, deep indigo, slow pulse/mist |

### Archetype Glyphs
Each of the 12 archetypes will anchor a core glyph or symbol within the portal design. These glyphs serve as **spiritual signatures** and may animate or rotate subtly when active.

---

## 🔮 4. Interaction States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Idle** | Subtle animation; sigil breathes or glows |
| **Hover/Approach** | Energy ripple or glyph responds to proximity |
| **Activate** | Portal expands or opens with a light burst or inward draw |
| **Completed** | Portal pulses, then dissolves or seals with visual harmony |

---

## 🛠️ 5. Implementation Notes

- Designed to be used within the **Ritual Modal** system
- Can incorporate **soundscapes or ambient tones** per energy alignment
- Should be **responsive** and optimized for both desktop and mobile
- Ideally implemented with **Lottie animations** or SVG + CSS motion layers

## ✨ Next Steps

- [ ] Generate 3 Ritual Portal concept images (Light, Neutral, Dark)
- [ ] Create base Lottie animation spec for Floating Sigil layout
- [ ] Assign glyph overlays to archetypes (visual glyph matrix)
- [ ] Integrate into Ritual Modal experience in Codex Lumina
