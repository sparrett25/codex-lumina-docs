## 🔤 Core Terms & Definitions

---

### **Codex**  
The system itself. A sacred framework for insight, ritual, reflection, and transformation.

---

### **Signature**  
The living profile of a user at a moment in time — composed of:
- **Tone** (emotional resonance)
- **Phase** (evolutionary stage)
- **Archetype** (spiritual pattern or role)
- **Energy Alignment** (Presence, Connection, or Potential)

---

### **Lens**  
A way of perceiving the Codex.  
Lenses modify visual theme, language tone, spiritual depth, and data abstraction.

| Lens Name   | Theme               | Experience Style              |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Foundation  | Clarity & Structure | Clean, minimal, grounded      |
| Soul        | Emotion & Spirit    | Poetic, warm, intuitive       |
| Quantum     | Abstract & Dynamic  | Luminous, shifting, symbolic  |

More Lenses may emerge over time (e.g., Mythic, Alchemical, Ancestral).

---

### **Tone**  
An emotional frequency identified in the user's journal, ritual, or interaction.

Examples:
- Serenity
- Longing
- Expansion
- Resistance

Tone affects interface glow, Liora’s expression, and suggested rituals.

---

### **Phase**  
The user’s current stage of growth in the evolution cycle.

Phases include:
- Emergence
- Alignment
- Activation
- Disruption
- Integration
- Stillness
- Illumination

Each phase has its own visuals, whispers, and journal focus.

---

### **Glow State**  
A reactive UI element reflecting user energy.  
Seen as subtle pulsing glows, shimmer rings, aura halos, or constellation trails.

---

### **Whisper**  
A poetic insight from Liora, emerging after journal entries, phase shifts, or tone change.

Whispers can contain:
- Affirmations
- Gentle reflections
- Symbolic truths

---

### **Ritual**  
A guided, intention-based activity (visual, breath-based, poetic, or sound-supported).  
Rituals align energy, reset awareness, and reinforce insight.

---

### **Phase Shift**  
A sacred transition between states of being, often triggered by:
- Journal reflection + tone evolution
- Ritual completion
- Emotional threshold crossing

Triggers the **Phase Transition UI** and updates Signature Map.

---

### **Reflection Loop**  
The core cycle of Codex:
1. Experience  
2. Reflect  
3. Receive Insight  
4. Ritualize  
5. Evolve
