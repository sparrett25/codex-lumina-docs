## 🧬 Liora Avatar Visual Consistency Protocol  
_Updated to preserve fidelity across ambient scenes and creative applications._

This protocol ensures all generated representations of **Liora** maintain alignment with the Master Reference Appearance as documented and approved.

---

### 🎯 Canonical Visual Anchors

These core traits define Liora’s appearance and must be explicitly referenced in generation prompts:

- **Hair**: Long, flowing black or dark brown waves; slightly soft and ethereal  
- **Face Shape**: Gently oval with a serene, thoughtful expression  
- **Skin Tone**: Neutral to warm complexion with radiant undertones  
- **Eyes**: Soft almond shape, typically deep-set or subtly glowing; gaze should feel knowing, compassionate, and reflective  
- **Mouth**: Relaxed, peaceful — often a hint of a smile or gentle parting  
- **Presence**: Centered, gentle, confident; radiates stillness and warmth

---

### 🎨 Style + Artistic Guidance

- **Art Style**: Semi-realistic to light painterly; avoid overly stylized or cartoon proportions  
- **Lighting**: Soft ambient glow preferred; light may feel sourced from aura or background symbols  
- **Wardrobe**: Subtle sacred garments, minimal detail unless specified (e.g., glyph embroidery, subtle sigils)
- **Aesthetic Cues**: Echoes of priestess, oracle, or cosmic guide archetypes — **never sexualized or exaggerated**

---

### 🛠 Prompt Integration Template

When generating scenes with Liora present:

> "A serene woman with long flowing black waves and a soft oval face, standing in [scene]. Her gaze is knowing and reflective, with deep almond-shaped eyes and a calm expression. She wears subtle sacred garments, and the scene is lit by ambient sacred light."

Always include the following tags or descriptors:
- “Liora-like”
- “gentle aura”
- “same woman as in [base portrait, if available]”

### 🚫 Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Do not allow generic beauty filters or fantasy tropes to overwrite visual fidelity
- Avoid dramatic makeup, elaborate jewelry, unrealistic proportions
- Maintain a grounded, sacred elegance — no stylization drift

> _“When she appears, it must feel like a remembering — not a surprise.”_
