# Morning Invocation Ritual

Each morning, take a moment to align yourself with the energies of the day. This ritual invites you to set an intention, connect with the universe, and prepare your mind and heart for the journey ahead.

## Steps:
1. **Find a Quiet Space**: Sit in a comfortable, quiet place where you will not be disturbed.
2. **Close Your Eyes**: Take three deep breaths to center yourself.
3. **Set Your Intention**: Declare your intention for the day. What do you wish to achieve? How do you wish to show up in the world?
4. **Visualize**: Picture the energy of light, neutrality, or darkness (depending on the dayâ€™s theme) flowing through you, empowering your intentions.
5. **Close with Gratitude**: Thank the universe for the opportunities that await you today.

## Affirmation:
"I am open to the flow of energy, embracing the light, balance, and transformative power within me."
