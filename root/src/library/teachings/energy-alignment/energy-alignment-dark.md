# Energy Alignment: Dark

Dark energy is the force of potential, the unseen, and the hidden. It represents mystery, introspection, and the power of the unknown. Those aligned with dark energy may feel drawn to explore deeper truths and uncover hidden aspects of themselves and the world.

## Key Concepts:
- **Potential**: The unseen power within, waiting to be revealed.
- **Introspection**: The ability to dive deeply into the self and uncover hidden truths.
- **Mystery**: Embracing the unknown and the transformative power of darkness.

## Practices:
- **Shadow Work**: Confront your fears, limitations, and unresolved emotions to integrate them into your consciousness.
- **Solitude**: Spend time alone in nature or a quiet space to reflect and explore your inner world.
- **Journaling**: Write about your hidden desires, fears, and any unresolved emotions that surface.

## Guided Exercise:
Sit quietly in a darkened room, or at night with minimal light. Close your eyes and reflect on any aspects of yourself that you may have ignored or avoided. Allow these aspects to come into your awareness. What feelings or thoughts arise? Allow the darkness to show you what needs to be transformed. Journal your reflections.
