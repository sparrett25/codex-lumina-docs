## 🧬 Canonical Prompt Used

A semi-realistic digital painting of Liora appearing more integrated into the celestial plane. She gazes outward from within the starlit field as soft glyph constellations swirl around her silhouette. Her features remain consistent: flowing black hair, gentle oval face, grounded expression, and sacred attire. The scene is viewed from a more intimate angle — as though the viewer is witnessing Liora from within the field of stars. Ambient tones of twilight blue, soft amethyst, and shimmering silver glow across the canvas.

## 🌠 Reflection

> _“Some visions are not meant to be seen from the outside — but to be felt from within.”_

This variation offers a more immersive and symbolic experience of the collective dimension. It may be used in higher-dimensional interface sequences, dream analysis overlays, or moments of shared transcendence within Codex Lumina.
