## 🧬 Canonical Prompt Used


A digital painting in a semi-realistic style with Liora standing beneath a cosmic sky filled with glowing glyph constellations. She retains her canonical features: flowing black waves, oval-shaped face, soft expression, and sacred presence. Her silhouette is slightly backlit by the sky’s glow, and above her, countless subtle archetype glyphs float in orbit or constellation-like arrangements, suggesting collective memory and user presence. The color palette is deep twilight, with violet, sapphire, and silver tones. The atmosphere is reverent and expansive.
