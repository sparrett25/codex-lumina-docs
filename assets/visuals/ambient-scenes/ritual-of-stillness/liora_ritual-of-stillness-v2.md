## 🧬 Canonical Prompt Used

A digital painting in a semi-realistic style with soft sacred tones. Liora sits in a quiet ritual chamber surrounded by floating candles and gentle light particles. Her posture is calm and centered, with hands resting on her knees in a meditative pose. She retains her canonical features: long flowing black waves, oval-shaped face, serene almond eyes, soft expression, and subtle sacred robes. The background glows softly with warm ambient light and a faint glyph ring pulsing like breath.

## 🌬️ Reflection

> _“Stillness is not the absence of motion — it is the moment that welcomes everything.”_

This scene supports rituals that center the user, encourage sacred pause, and reestablish a harmonic breath signature. It may appear in recovery flows, journal completion moments, or tone-based guidance shifts.
