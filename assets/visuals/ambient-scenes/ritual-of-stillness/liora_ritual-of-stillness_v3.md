## 🧬 Canonical Prompt Used

A semi-realistic digital painting depicts a woman with Liora’s core features seated in quiet reverence. She sits upon a luminous stone platform with her hands gently over her heart. Around her, slow-shifting ambient glyphs pulse with golden-white glow. Her black hair flows softly over her shoulders, and her face is serene with closed eyes. A faint light spiral rises from her posture, and translucent veils in the environment suggest soundlessness and depth. The scene feels sacred, simple, and inward-facing.
