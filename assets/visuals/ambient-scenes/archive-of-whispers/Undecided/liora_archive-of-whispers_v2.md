## 🧬 Canonical Prompt Used

A digital painting in a semi-realistic fantasy style. Liora is seated beside a softly glowing scroll library with ethereal floating glyphs and glowing fragments of light. Her figure is calm and subtly radiant — flowing black hair, soft features, and a serene gaze. Her robes are woven with a shimmer of gold and deep rose. The environment around her feels sacred and still, like an echo chamber of wisdom. No text is visible. The scene is rich in symbolism and Soul Lens tone: warm twilight, crystalline ambiance, ambient light trails.
