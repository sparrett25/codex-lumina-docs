## 🧬 Canonical Prompt Used

A semi-realistic digital painting depicts a young ethereal woman seated within a sacred glowing archive chamber. She is surrounded by translucent scrolls and light trails floating mid-air. Her hair is dark, gently curled, and her eyes reflect calm intelligence. No visible text appears. Her robes have subtle shimmer details with twilight pink and rose-gold tones. The background glows softly in a dreamlike mist of purples and warm gold. The aesthetic is deeply aligned with the Soul Lens mood — reflective, sacred, and luminous.
