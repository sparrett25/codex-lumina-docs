## 🧬 Canonical Prompt Used

A digital painting in a semi-realistic style with a soft poetic aura. Liora stands in a luminous archive surrounded by floating scrolls and glowing symbols. Her appearance matches her canonical form: flowing black waves, oval face, calm gaze, soft almond-shaped eyes, subtle sacred robe. The background is ambient and ethereal with golden tones, particle light, and reflective surfaces. This is a sacred space of stored wisdom. Her posture is elegant, with one hand reaching toward a whisper scroll that glows faintly.
