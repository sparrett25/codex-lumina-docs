## 🧬 Canonical Prompt Used



A digital painting in a blend of fantasy and realistic tone shows Liora standing beside a luminous mirrored veil. Her canonical features are present: soft black hair, gentle face, calm expression, and elegant robes. Her hand touches the veil, and the mirror responds with glowing glyphs around her hand. The reflection shows a brighter version of herself, as though she is glimpsing her future self or a higher version. The ambient tones are warm and symbolic, in harmony with Soul Lens style — soft golds, twilight rose, and radiant silver.
