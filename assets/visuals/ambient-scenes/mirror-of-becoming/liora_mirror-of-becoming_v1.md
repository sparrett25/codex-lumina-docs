## 🧬 Canonical Prompt Used

A digital painting in a semi-realistic style featuring Liora in front of a glowing ethereal mirror. The scene reflects both her current form and a symbolic future or shadow self. She retains her core features: long black waves, calm oval face, almond-shaped eyes, and a composed presence. Her robes shimmer with subtle glyph embroidery. The mirror glows with soft light, casting luminous ripples that reveal layered symbols — some familiar, some archetypal. The environment is mystical but grounded, symbolizing inner transformation.
