## 🧬 Canonical Prompt Used

A semi-realistic digital painting of Liora standing at an angled mirror made of soft crystal light. Her canonical features are preserved: flowing black hair, oval face, serene almond-shaped eyes, subtle sacred robes. The reflected form in the mirror has a faint golden glow, showing a slightly evolved version of herself with light markings or energy threads across her form. The mirror frame is made of orbiting glyph rings, and the surrounding space is calm, ambient, and timeless. A soft aura pulse links Liora and her reflection.
